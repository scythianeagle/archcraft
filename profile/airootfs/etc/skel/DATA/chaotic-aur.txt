Recommendations:

    You may want to use powerpill to download from all mirrors simultaneously. We recommend doing updates this way: 
    
  sudo pacman -Sy && sudo powerpill -Su && paru -Su
    
    
    Make sure to insert all mirrors in your pacman.conf or use chaotic-mirrorlist with all of them active if using powerpill.
    
    
    If you are using other third party repositories, we recommend putting Chaotic-AUR prior to them in 
    
    /etc/pacman.conf
    Since we update most packages hourly and follow AUR PKGBUILDs, this repository is more suitable as first option when downloading packages.
   
   
    If you need to omit a package update to use locally built ones (e.g: with native optimizations), you can add 'IgnorePkg = ...' to repo's section in /etc/pacman.conf
    
    
    You can pick the repository which to download a package from like this: pacman -S chaotic-aur/dxvk-mingw-git. Some AUR helpers support it too, e.g: paru -S aur/firefox-hg
    
    
    
    You must have multilib repository enabled.
